I will try to leave most values easy to tweak, and will keep most textures on a few different documents and image source sheets. it should be relitively easy to add more images to the img folder, and unused images can be safely stored in the 'sourceImages' folder without breaking anything. The 'img' document should allow you to add more as you wish.
